# Regression on diamonds price

## Intro

Diamonds are precious stones consisting of a clear and colourless crystalline form of pure carbon. They are the hardest gemstones known to man and can be scratched only by other diamonds.

Diamonds are formed deep within the Earth about 100 miles or so below the surface in the upper mantle. Obviously, the temperature of this part of the Earth is very high. Plus, there is a lot of pressure, the weight of the overlying rock bearing down. The combination of high temperature and high pressure is whatâ€™s necessary to grow diamond crystals in the Earth.

Diamonds are rare because of the incredibly powerful forces needed to create them and therefore they are considered to be very costly.

The goal of this project is to do a regression on diamond prices. To do that we will present the dataset we will use, and then present the methods used and their results.
